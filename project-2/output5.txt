***** Showing the connections that were established
I1,  Output = A100
I2,  Output = A100
I3,  Output = M120
I4,  Output = S130
A100, Input 1 = I1, Input 2 = I2, Output = T110
M120, Input 1 = T110, Input 2 = I3, Output = S130
T110, Input 1 = A100, Output = M120
S130, Input 1 = M120, Input 2 = I4, Output = O50
O50, Input 1 = S130
